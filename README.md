  Guess the football player by career

  <b>
    This Android application is a game.
  </b>
</div>

<div>
  The goal is to <mark>guess and form a footballer's name</mark> using the letters located at the bottom of the screen. When you tap
  a letter, it moves to the input field. Tapping a letter in the input field moves it back down. Letters are inserted sequentially.
  There are more letters than are in the name. A dictionary of letter frequency was used to generate the extra letters.
  The top part of the screen features the <mark>emblems of football clubs and the transfer dates</mark> of the mystery footballer in chronological order.
</div>

<div>
  <br>
  There are <mark>5 chapters</mark>, with the next one unlocking after completing the previous one. <mark>Each chapter has 40 levels</mark>.
  The difficulty increases with each level, as each subsequent footballer has lower popularity and recognizability.
